## Exciting Internship Opportunity with COGNIFY Technologies üéâ

### Position: Data Science Intern ‚ù§Ô∏èüí´

As a Data Science Intern, I am engaged in a variety of tasks focused on data collection, cleaning, interpretation, and the development of data-driven solutions. The internship experience is structured into three progressive levels, each comprising three specific tasks.

### **Level 1: Foundational Tasks**

**Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Investigate the dataset to determine its structure, including the number of rows and columns.
- Assess and manage missing values within each column.
- Perform necessary data type conversions and analyze the distribution of the target variable, "Aggregate Rating," while identifying class imbalances.

**Task 2: Descriptive Analysis**
- Compute essential statistical metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- Explore the distributions of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
- Highlight the top cuisines and cities with the greatest concentration of restaurants.

**Task 3: Geospatial Analysis**
- Visualize restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude data.
- Examine the distribution of restaurants across various cities and countries.
- Investigate correlations between a restaurant‚Äôs location and its aggregate rating.

### **Level 2: Intermediate Analysis**

**Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery**
- Analyze the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services.
- Compare average ratings between restaurants that provide table booking and those that do not.
- Investigate online delivery options across various price ranges.

**Task 2: Price Range Analysis**
- Identify the most prevalent price range among restaurants.
- Calculate the average ratings for each price bracket.
- Determine which price range correlates with the highest average ratings.

**Task 3: Feature Engineering**
- Extract new features from existing data, such as the length of restaurant names or addresses.
- Create binary features indicating the availability of table booking and online delivery by encoding categorical variables.

### **Level 3: Advanced Techniques**

**Task 1: Predictive Modeling**
- Develop a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of restaurants based on various features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
- Experiment with different algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, comparing their effectiveness.

**Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis**
- Examine the connection between cuisine types and restaurant ratings.
- Identify the most favored cuisines based on the number of votes received.
- Determine if certain cuisines consistently achieve higher ratings.

**Task 3: Data Visualization**
- Generate visual representations of rating distributions using histograms, bar charts, and more.
- Compare average ratings across different cuisines and cities through appropriate visual methods.
- Visualize the relationships between various features and the target variable to derive insights.
